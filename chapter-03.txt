The apology

Lowell catches up with Charlie and apologizes for how things went the night before.


"I'm sorry things went the way they did this morning," Lowell said as he matched stride with Charlie. He had seen her walking through the Town Square and decided he needed to clear the air.
She whipped her head around, eyes flashing and confusion in her brows. "No big deal," she said - too gruffly, he thought.
"I just wanted to clear things up. I know how things usually go for us -- "
"I said, it's no big deal."
"Charlie --"
"Lowell, " she said, turning on her heel to face him. "You have been everything to me since Chase died. And you stayed when I left. But your life is here. I'm sorry you regret sleeping together this morning. You said no last night, and I should have respected it. I'm sorry. You've moved on, it seems, and that's ok. I get it. It's no big deal." She poked him with her finger as she said each of the last three words.
Lowell had stopped in his tracks when she turned on him. Now, she whirled around and continued walking. Regret sleeping with her? Where did she get that idea. He was trying to apologize for it being so quick, and not at all romantic. Not how he wanted it to happen, anyway. He had wanted her to want him, more than physically. How could he get her to see that he would wait a hundred years, or more, for her?
She finally stopped walking when a dull roar echoed through the streets. As it approached, a wide grin spread over her face.
The Softtail Harley rolled into view and Lowell's heart sank. The bald, tattooed biker astride the bike looked like he should be playing pro football. He wore a flannel shirt, like Lowell, but the sleeves were torn off at the shoulders, and his thermal shirt hugged his biceps. His jeans looked like they were painted on his thighs. As the biker pulled his bike into a parking pot, Lowell noticed Charlie running to greet him. Running. It looked like he had missed his chance afterall. But, then why did she make love to him this morning?
Just as curious about the newcomer as everyone else in town, Lowell's feet started moving toward them. He lowered his gaze to the ground as he walked, but not before he saw Charlie jump into the guy's arms. He swung her around in a circle, and she laughed. No - giggled!
"Roxie! What are you doing here?" Charlie asked him between laughs.
Charlie had mentioned Roxie before, but Lowell though it was a girl.
"Just passing through, Chuckie. Just stopped to buy you a coffee. You got decent coffee around here?"
This was gonna get messy, and Lowell didn't want a mess. He never imagined that Charlie was celibate when she was off in her world. Heck, he wasn't either. But her worlds had never crossed over before. She always kept them separate. Yet his feet kept bringing him closer to the pair, like a magnet. Damn, she was beautiful when she smiled. And it was so good to hear her laugh.
Just then, she spotted him coming closer and she climbed down from the bear's arms. Lowell felt like a giraffe next to him. The scene in front of him cut like a knife.
Charlie grabbed Roxie's hand and lead him tot he sidewalk where Lowell had stopped.
"Lowell, this is Roxie. Roxie, Lowell."
"Hey, man. How ya doin'?" Roxie smiled as he offered his hand.
"Hey, man," Lowell replied, taking the handshake. "Nice to meet you." Lowell did his best to be civil, but he wanted this bear of a man to die by a thousand cuts. He released Roxie's hand before his emotions poured out of his hand.
Charlie wrapped herself in Roxie's arm and asked, "Who's got the best coffee these days, Lowell?"
"Uh, well, there's Capricorn Coffee over on Sprice, but all the yuppies go there. We got lunch startin' up over at Jake's. I can setup a fresh pot, if you want." Why coudln't he send her away? Inviting the bear to the den was not a good idea.
"Roxie, you've got to try their Mushu Pork. Nothing else like it in the whole state," Charlie gushed.
"Yeah? Sounds good to me."
Lowell grunted something as he turned around and headed back to the bar. This was not going to be a good day.

The ruse

Charlie fills Roxie in on the plan and they head to the bar for lunch.


Charlie felt a little guilty as she watched Lowell walk away. They had been hooking up for years, and she always felt bad that she couldn't give Lowell what he deserved. Every year, she fully expected to come home and find him in love with some girl from town. Of course, when she had called Lucy last night and asked her to send Roxie, she and Lowell hadn't seen each other yet. She had no idea that things were going to go the way they did. She could still feel his mouth on her body and his fingers inside her. The explosion when she came was unlike anything she had every experienced before, even with Lowell. Things were definitely different this time. And she didn't know if she wanted them to be, or what to do about it.
"So, you wanna tell me what that was all about," Roxie asked as he spun her around to rest his arms on her shoulders, nose-to-nose.
"Sorry. Maybe I laid it on a little thick, but he needs to see it." Charlie blushed as she spoke. It had been a long time since she and Roxie had been this intimate. Her fast friendship with Lucy had put an abrupt end to any kind of physical relationship she had with Roxie.
"Honey, when you called Lucy last night, we though you needed help with the car or something. What exactly do you have in mind?"
Charlie turned in the direction of Jake's and started walking. Roxie followed.
"Oh, Rox. I don't know what I was thinking. When I called Lucy, I hadn't seen Lowell yet. I just had this feeling when I came into town that something was changing. He came over last night, like he always does when I get home. But it was different somehow. And we didn't hook up, but then we did. I thought that would be a good thing, but it just made me feel so uneasy. I don't know how to get him to see that I'm not worth waiting for."
"I'm sure he's wondering how to get you to see that you are worth it."
"What?"
"Chuckie, you know that boy is in love with you, right?"
"I know, Rox. I know. I don't know a time when I didn't know that. But I can't let him in. I just can't. Losing him would kill me." Tears formed in her eyes as she thought about life without Lowell. She knew it was silly to take it for granted that he would always be here, but she couldn't pin him down, either, because she couldn't be here all the time. She couldn't face all the places and memories.
"Hon, you can't lose him if you haven't found him."
They were almost to the bar now, and Charlie had to get their stories straight.
"Listen, just stay for the day and pretend to be my boyfriend. You can leave this eveing, after dinner."
"What about Lucy? Almost all our good stories include her."
Charlie thought for a second. "No one has to know she's your wife. We can tell them she's your sister."
"I don't see how this will end well for you, Chuckie, but ok. Hey, did you tell Lucy what you were planning?"
"Roxie, it was her idea."

Lunch

Lowell serves Charlie & Roxie lunch in the bar. Jess tries to convince Lowell to tell Charlie how he feels. Junie tries to connect with Lowell.


Lowell was wiping the bar down when he saw them come in. He had started a fresh pot of coffee when he got back, so he poured two cups and sent them over with Rachel when they picked a booth. He also hollered back to Kenny to start an order of potstickers. She always ate potstickers.
"I know I've only been back for a couple of weeks," Jess said into his ear, "but if I didn't know better, I'd say you were jealous."
He snapped his head around. "Jealous? Me? Of what?" His voice was a strange sound he'd never heard before.
"Wow. I was only joking, but I'm right, aren't I? Your eyes are shooting daggers, and your eyebrows are almost a uni-brow."
"No, not at all," he squeezed out, clearing his throat.
Jess settled on a stool at the end of the bar. She had graduated with Lowell and Charlie, then gone to culinary school and the city life. She had just come back to town after a rough divorce, and she and Lowell became fast friends.
For her, Lowell was someone who knew her before her life truned inside out. For him, Jess was someone who knew him without Charlie. Their different lives had given them each a chance to be unburdened in thier friendship.
Her gaze wandered to Charlie and Roxie in the booth. Roxie was telling her some sort of story, and she hung on every word, laughing as he waved his hands around in some sort of demonstration.
Lowell's gaze followed Jess' and his heart ached. He wanted to have that same effect on Charlie. But their connection seemed stuck in the past. They only seened to share sadness.
"Lowell, you've got to tell her how you feel."
The bar was buzzing with customers now, with the lunch rush in full swing. Lowell stepped closer to Jess so he could hear her. "What did you say?"
"I said, you've got to tell her --"
Lowell stepped closer and leaned in. "I still can't hear you."
Jess stretched up in the stool to talk into his ear. "You've got to tell her how you feel."
Their faces were next to each other, but he turned to her ear and replied. "Jess, first, you don't know what you're talking about. And, second, it's none of your buiness."
Still cheek-to-cheek, she teased him. "Don't be such a guy."
"She's just gonna leave anyway, so it doesn't really matter, does it? Look, what are ya having today?"
Jess gave him her order as Kenny hollered from the back, "Boss, I need more egg rolls from the freezer, but I don't have enough hands! Are you gonna get more hands?"
Lowell rolled his eyes as he backed away from Jess. "Such a drama queen, that kid," chuckling. "I'll be back with your order soon."
Jess hopped down from the bar stool and followed Lowell to the kitchen. "You are being a complete dunderhead," she said.
Lowell looked back at her. "What are you doing back here?"
"You need to tell Charlie how you feel about her. Why would she stay if she doesn't think she has anything to stay for?"
Lowell looked at Kenny, and he blinked, his eyes big and round, like a cartoon character.
"Don't look at me," Kenny shrugged. "I'm just the baby brother. If she won't stay for me, I don't know what to tell you."
Lowell shook his head, glancing back at Jess. "Look, you really don't know anything about it. I know we were friends back then, but you left."
"So did she."
Lowell took a step toward Jess, forgetting the knife in his hand as he pointed it at her. "I am not going to tell her that I can't breathe when she's not here. I am not going to tell her that I live in black and white for most of the year, seeing only color when she's here. I am not going to tell her that the world stands still from New Year's until Christmas every year. She has to want to stay, becuase I'm not gonna make her."
Jess' eyes had welled up with tears while he spoke. "That is the most beutiful thing I've ever heard. Now go tell her."
"No," Lowell said, moving back tot he counter to take his frustration out on the food.
"Lowell, did you ever think that maybe she doesn't have to stay? Maybe you can go with her. You both have these distant memories, but you can make new memories together."
"Jess, you're amazing, but I'm done talking about this," he said, looking up at her from his cutting board. "Now get outta my kitchen."
Jess shook her head and laughed as she turned around and headed back to the bar.
"What are you looking at, kid?" Lowell growled at Kenny, who stood completely still, with his cartoon eyes still wide open.
"I'm looking at the dumbest guy in the world," he said as he resumed his work, shaking his head.

Not on my watch

Charlie arrives at Jake's to greet people she knows. She is surprised to find Lowell absent. After prompting from others in the bar, Charlie sets off for him in the store room, only to find Lowell and Junie in a compromising situation.


The food was amazing, as always. The coffee was passable and fresh, as promised. Rachel seemed to provide a bottomless pot and kept refilling their coffee and water. Charlie wasn't surprised when the potstickers arrived. Lowell knew her too well, and the Mushu Pork they ordered was the best in the state, as she claimed.
As they ate, Charlie couldn't help but notice the intimate conversation Lowell was having with a girl at the bar. She looked a little familiar, but Charlie couldn't place her. She was glad he seemed to have other relationships, but then she got a little bothered that he had come over last night anyway, even though he had something going on with this other girl. Hooking up was one thing. But the things he said made her think there wasn't anyone else.
She tried not to focus on it while they ate. Roxie asked about the people in the bar as they paraded through, and Charlie tried to fill him in, as best she could. She knew she should recognize more people than she did - she had grown up with them. But she couldn't help feeling disconnected from the place she called home. Junie had stopped by and said hello, as had half the other people in town that she had gone to school with.
Roxie had headed to the bathroom, and Charlie wanted to take a minute to thank Lowell for the great lunch, but she didn't see him anywhere.
"Kenny, where's Lowell?" she asked through the service window.
"What am I, his babysitter? He's probably in the back getting stuff. All my bins are empty up here."
No stranger to the bar, Charlie ducked behind the counter and headed for the store room. She was glad her brother had been able to get a job here, and hoped it would be a good connection for him. Something to help him move forward, and not stuck in the mud.
As she rounded the corner, she heard giggling and almost turned back. But it was too late. Her eyes locked with Lowell as he was being groped by none other than Junie Watling - the mewling cat who'd been after Lowell since high school. He had his back to the wall, and Junie was trying to climb him like a tree, making these little squeaking sounds as her hands ran over his chest.
Charlie turned on her heels and dashed out of there, steam rising in her ears. She nearly ran into Roxie outside the men's room.
"Come on, we're done here."
"Chuckie, you ok?"
Lowell came racing out of the store room, calling her name, Junie right behind him.
"Lowell, baby. Come back. When are we gonna get together again?"
Lowell turned and faced her. "Junie, how many times do I have to tell you that I'm not into you like that. It's been eight years, and you still don't listen. Please, find someone else."
Roxie heard the exchange, but Charlie was too focused on leaving. She had grabbed Roxie's hand and was dragging him out the front door.
"That conniving, scheming, philandering dung beetle! I can't believe he did that to me. What was I thinking? I went to all this trouble to convince him to move on, only to find out that he's moved on multiple times, and didn't even care that much about me at all!"
Roxie was completely confused. "Chuckie, what are you talking about? What happened?"
"Did you see how he was leading on that girl during lunch? They were cheek-to-cheek in some deep conversation like she was the only girl in the world. Then, I walk in on him making out with Junie in the store room, like we're in high school again! How many other girls are there?"
"But I thought you wanted him to move on."
"That was before --. That was when I thought..." she couldn't find the words. She looked at Roxie, and he looked like he was about to burst out laughing. Her anger heated up again. "That was when I thought he was holding out for me. Now I find out he's just playing everybody. What was I thinking?"
"Do you actually know what happened? You only come here once a year, and you only ever get part of the story. Maybe it isn't what you think."
"Are you siding with him, Jason Rockford? Are you actually taking his side?"
"Come on, Chuck. I am always on your side. I wouldn't be here otherwise. I want you to be happy. I want what's best for you. But sometimes we can't always see what's best for us. Life gets dirty and muddy, and it's hard to see clearly."
"Yeah. Don't I know it. Aaaargh - I can't believe I felt sorry for him."
"Listen, I heard some of what they said back there. Lowell wasn't into her. You've got to give him a chance."
"What, a chance to get in my pants again? A chance to try to convince me to stay? I'm not staying to watch him fool around with half the town."
Roxie took her hand and stroked it with his thumb in a calming way. "Come on, Chuckie. Let's get on the bike and hit some open road for a little bit. Let you cool off."
"Yeah, I need some space. Let's go."
As they got on the bike and headed out of town, they didn't see that Lowell had followed. And they didn't see him sink to the ground as they faded away down the road.
