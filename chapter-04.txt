CHAPTER FOUR

The wind cooled Charlie's face. Riding was so freeing, and she could always think clearly on the back of a motorcycle. So what if Lowell was with someone else. So what if he had a girlfriend. It explained why he stopped her last night, but it didn't explain this morning. What they had was casual, but she would be damned if she was going to be the other woman.

Well, that doesn't make sense either. If what they have is casual, then there will be others. She will be the other woman. It's not up to her to decide that he has something special with someone else. Right? Gah - this was all so confusing.

The bike slowed and Roxie pulled over to the side of the road.

"You've got to tell me where to steer this thing. I don't know where you want to go," he said.

"Can't we just keep riding?" she asked hopefully.

Roxie turned around in his seat. "Hon, I'd love to, but you keep muttering to yourself back there, and I'm afraid you're gonna jump off. You are not alright, and I want to talk with you. Should we do it here, or do you want to go somewhere?"

"The cemetery. I'll drive" she said, firmly. She needed to talk to Chase.

She climbed off the bike so Roxie could get off without kicking her. Then, she got back on, and he followed. She started up the bike and turned around to head back towards town. The cemetery was on the edge of town, so she wouldn't risk running into Lowell, or anyone else she knew.
